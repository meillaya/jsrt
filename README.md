# jsrt — Tiny JavaScript Interpreter in C

`jsrt` is a small JavaScript-like interpreter written in C as a learning exercise.

## Current Scope

The interpreter currently supports:
- hand-written lexer
- recursive-descent parser
- explicit AST
- tree-walk evaluator
- variables
- arithmetic and comparison operators
- string literals and string concatenation with `+`
- array literals and indexing
- object literals with dot / bracket access
- property and index assignment with shared-reference aggregate semantics
- `for` loops plus `break` / `continue`
- `do...while` loops
- `switch` / `case` / `default` with JS/C-style fallthrough
- `while` loops
- logical operators `&&` and `||`
- `if` / `else`
- function declarations, calls, closures, and `return`
- function expressions and anonymous closures
- `const` declarations with initializer-required, no-reassign semantics
- source-based lexer/parser/runtime diagnostics with caret markers
- parser recovery to the next statement boundary with aggregated parse errors
- tracing collection for unreachable closure/environment cycles
- manual memory management with explicit destroy paths

## Explicit Non-goals

These are intentionally deferred past the current milestone:
- full heap garbage collection for every runtime allocation (N8 is explicitly bounded to `Env`, `JsFunction`, `JsArray`, and `JsObject`)
- bytecode VM / JIT
- async / event loop behavior
- modules, classes, prototypes
- browser or Node host APIs
- broad ECMAScript compatibility

## Ownership Rules

jsrt uses explicit ownership rules instead of a garbage collector:
- `TokenArray` owns token lexeme strings and must be released with `token_array_free`.
- `StmtArray` / AST nodes own all nested expressions, statements, parameter names, identifier strings, array elements, and object literal properties; release them with `stmt_array_free` / `stmt_destroy`.
- `Env` values form live lexical scope chains; function values retain the environment where they were declared.
- Function bindings can create reference cycles, so a small tracing collector reclaims unreachable closure/environment graphs at safe execution points and final cleanup.
- Arrays and objects preserve shared identity across environment reads/writes, property access, index access, function arguments, and returns.
- Property/index assignment mutates the shared aggregate, so aliases observe the same updates by design.
- `EvalResult.value` is owned by the caller and must be released with `value_free`.

## Current roadmap focus

The active runtime milestone is **M3 — mutable aggregate/reference model implementation**. Its execution contract lives in:
- `.omx/plans/adr-javascript-runtime-m2-aggregate-semantics.md`
- `.omx/plans/prd-javascript-runtime-roadmap-m3-mutable-aggregate-reference-model.md`
- `.omx/plans/test-spec-javascript-runtime-roadmap-m3-mutable-aggregate-reference-model.md`

M3 implements the M2 decision while staying intentionally bounded:
1. stop cloning arrays/objects across environment boundaries
2. make alias-visible mutation work through bindings, nested access, function arguments, and returns
3. keep strings/scalars unchanged and keep GC scope bounded
4. harden cyclic aggregate stringification/equality enough to stay safe

Likely follow-ons after M3:
1. M4 — built-in library foundation on the clarified aggregate model
2. M6 — backend/IR planning on the cleaner heap model
3. M5 — runtime error model cleanup as the runtime surface grows
