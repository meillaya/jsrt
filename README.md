# jsrt — Tiny JavaScript Interpreter in C

`jsrt` is a small JavaScript-like interpreter written in C as a learning exercise.

## Current Scope

The interpreter currently supports:
- hand-written lexer
- recursive-descent parser
- explicit AST
- tree-walk evaluator
- bytecode compiler/disassembler MVP for a bounded subset
- opt-in VM parity backend for that bounded subset
- widened opt-in VM surface for aggregates and structured control flow
- variables
- arithmetic and comparison operators
- string literals and string concatenation with `+`
- built-in functions: `print`, `len`, `typeOf`
- array literals and indexing
- object literals with dot / bracket access
- property and index assignment with shared-reference aggregate semantics
- `for` loops plus `break` / `continue`
- `do...while` loops
- `switch` / `case` / `default` with JS/C-style fallthrough
- `while` loops
- logical operators `&&` and `||`
- `if` / `else`
- function declarations, calls, closures, and `return`
- function expressions and anonymous closures
- `const` declarations with initializer-required, no-reassign semantics
- source-based lexer/parser/runtime diagnostics with caret markers
- parser recovery to the next statement boundary with aggregated parse errors
- tracing collection for unreachable closure/environment cycles
- manual memory management with explicit destroy paths

## Explicit Non-goals

These are intentionally deferred past the current milestone:
- full heap garbage collection for every runtime allocation (N8 is explicitly bounded to `Env`, `JsFunction`, `JsArray`, and `JsObject`)
- bytecode VM / JIT
- async / event loop behavior
- modules, classes, prototypes
- browser or Node host APIs
- broad ECMAScript compatibility

## Ownership Rules

jsrt uses explicit ownership rules instead of a garbage collector:
- `TokenArray` owns token lexeme strings and must be released with `token_array_free`.
- `StmtArray` / AST nodes own all nested expressions, statements, parameter names, identifier strings, array elements, and object literal properties; release them with `stmt_array_free` / `stmt_destroy`.
- `Env` values form live lexical scope chains; function values retain the environment where they were declared.
- Function bindings can create reference cycles, so a small tracing collector reclaims unreachable closure/environment graphs at safe execution points and final cleanup.
- Arrays and objects preserve shared identity across environment reads/writes, property access, index access, function arguments, and returns.
- Property/index assignment mutates the shared aggregate, so aliases observe the same updates by design.
- `EvalResult.value` is owned by the caller and must be released with `value_free`.

## Current roadmap focus

The active runtime milestone is **M10 — VM closure + function-expression parity**. Its execution contract lives in:
- `.omx/plans/prd-javascript-runtime-roadmap-m10-vm-closure-function-expression-parity.md`
- `.omx/plans/test-spec-javascript-runtime-roadmap-m10-vm-closure-function-expression-parity.md`
- `docs/vm-parity-backend.md`

M10 stays intentionally bounded:
1. add closure capture and function-expression support on the VM path
2. prove parity against tree-walk on the existing closure-oriented examples/tests
4. keep the VM opt-in while tree-walk remains semantic authority

Likely follow-ons after M10:
1. broader closure-semantics hardening only if later milestones explicitly require it
2. future backend expansion only after bounded parity evidence exists
3. performance/benchmark work once backend scope stabilizes
